/// @brief Implementation of dumbbell swimmers.
///
/// The number, type, size, and other properties of the swimmers are read from the input file. They are initialised,
/// then forces are taken into account.
///
/// The swimmers repulse each other via a Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential. The monomers are coupled two-by-two with
/// either FENE, Hookean interaction, or a 6th order potential. More information on those potentials can be found
/// <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/elps.200800673">here</a>.
/// The swimmers can become non-interacting, ie no WCA force between different dimers, if the appropriate tag is turned
/// on.
///
/// These forces are used to integrate the swimmers' motions between timesteps. The swimmers interact with the fluid
/// with dipole forces and rotlets. Run/tumble dynamics and magnetic interactions can also be turned on.
///
/// This subroutine also sets swimmers in their randomized initial position, bins them, and links them.
