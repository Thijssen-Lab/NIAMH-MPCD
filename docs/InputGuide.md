## Introduction         {#introduction-in}

This is just meant to be a quick and dirty guide to the new MPCD JSON input system. It is not meant to be a complete reference. For basics on the JSON file format take a look at the tutorial series starting on [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp).

**Note:** The MPCD JSON input system is unverified with MD simulations as of yet.

Everything listed below should be in a single JSON file. 
Every parameter in the simulation can be fed in with a corresponding name/value pair. 
The name, or "tag", uniquely represents each parameter, is case sensitive, but can be given in any order within the json file. 

There are some exceptions to this rule, namely overrides.
Overrides do not correspond to simulation input parameters, but instead will override some other behaviour in a helpful manner.
These are given in their own table, and each override explained in more detail.

If a tag is not specified, then that parameter will assume the default value in the table below --- This means that, with the exception of some parameters used when declaring a BC, you may only need to specify several parameters in your input file.
Some defaults will instead set an override.

The table below lists all tags, their types, their default values, and their description.
Tags will generally be named the same as they are named in the code (in the various input structs), unless there is a good reason to change it for legibility or clarity.
When in doubt about which tags correspond to which variable names in the code, please consult SRDclss.h, definitions.h and the subroutine readJson() in read.c.

Some tags will take an array of custom objects (for example, species and boundary conditions). 
These are each defined in their own table following the main one.

We have added support for comments in the JSON by using comment tags.
If your tag is one of `"c"`, `"comment"`, `"//"`, or `"#"` then it will be ignored by the parser.
Comment tags can be repeated (despite it being invalid JSON) and not cause issues with the simulation.

## Tag Tables           {#tag-tables}

### Main Input Tag Table            {#main-input-tag-table}

All tags suffixed with "out", unless otherwise specified, take a value representing how frequently (in timesteps) you want that quantity to be dumped to file.

`MUN`           | double        | 1             | Multiplies the orientation in the normal direction on contact
`MUT`           | double        | 1             | Multiplies the orientation in the tangential direction on contact
`MUxyz`         | array(double) | [1,1,1]       | Multiplies the orientation in the cartesian direction on contact. **Must** be 3D

`inv`           | int           | 0             | Whether to invert the bc (ie, multiply the A's by -1). 0 = no, 1 = yes
`mass`          | double        | 1             | Mass of the wall in MPCD units. Should be the same density as the fluid if its displaceable

#### BC Overrides           {#bc-overrides}
Override Tag    | Type          | Override param| Description
---             | ---           | ---           | ---
`homeotropic`   | int           | `MUN`, `MUT`  | Setting this override with a value of 1 will give the wall homeotropic anchoring conditions
`planar`        | int           | `MUN`, `MUT`  | Setting this override with a value of 1 will give the wall planar anchoring conditions

## Example          {#example}
Below is an example JSON input file that uses all tags but sets them to the defaults.
As a reminder, if you wish to use the default value for a tag, you can leave it out of the JSON file, so this is primarily for illustrative purposes.

## Guide to Adding New Input Parameters         {#guide-to-adding-new-input-parameters}
Adding new parameters needs to be done within /mpcd/subroutines/read.c . 

First, ensure that the parameter you wish to "write to" exists in the code somewhere: 
This can be in the inputList struct or a global, but it needs to be accessible and passed to/ from read.c . 

Parameters are read from the JSON in the method `readJson()`.
The new parameter needs to be read **after** `initLL()` is called, but **before** `verifyJson()` is called.
As the order of parameters is irrelevent with the JSON, you can just append the new parameter to the end of the list.

The API for reading "tags" from the JSON makes use of three methods, one for varying tag types:
- `int getJObjInt(cJSON *cJSONRoot, const char* jsonTag, int d, linkedList *head)`:
- `double getJObjDou(cJSON *cJSONRoot, const char* jsonTag, double d, linkedList *head)`
- `void getJObjStr(cJSON *cJSONRoot, const char* jsonTag, const char* d, char **toReturn, linkedList *head)`

Each method has nearly identical parameters:
- `cJSONRoot`: the root of the JSON object, should be `jObj`
- `jsonTag`: the tag to search for
- `d`: the default value to return if the tag is not found
- `head`: the linked list to append the new parameter to, should be `jsonTagList`
Strings work a bit differently and you need to pass a reference to where you want to store the string in arg `toReturn`.

Setting up arrays is more complicated, a decent example is that of system dimensionality & size (controlled by tag `domain`).
Arrays of custom objects, such as species or BCs, are very complicated and not recommended to be done unless you're sure about what you're doing.
Overrides are, by definition, hacks, so how you implement them is very fast and loose.
